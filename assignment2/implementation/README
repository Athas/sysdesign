The file system implementation is contained in mnemosyne.py.  It
depends on whatever version of python-fuse is in Debian (it appears to
be version 0.2).

To run, use the following command:

python mnemosyne.py <mountpoint> -f -o root=<data storage>

A cleaner designed to remove unneeded revisions is available.

To run, use the following command:
python cleaner.py --dir=<data storage> --landmarktime=<ms>
    --landmarklimit=<days>
--dir
    Should point to the root of the data storage.

--landmarktime
    Sets the timelimit between revisions used
    in the landmark-policy. If two revisions are dated closer
    than the specified limit the older of the two are deleted.

--landmarklimit
    Specifies where the limit between KeepAll and Landmark-
    policies are. This is measured in days.
